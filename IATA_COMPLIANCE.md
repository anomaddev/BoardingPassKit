### ‚úÖ Supported Barcode Formats

According to IATA Resolution 792, BCBP can be encoded in:
- [x] PDF417 (most common)
- [x] Aztec
- [x] QR Code
- [x] Data Matrix

**Note:** This library decodes the ASCII data structure regardless of the barcode symbology used.

### üìã Version Information

**Important:** There are two different "versions" related to BCBP:

1. **IATA Implementation Guide Version** (Document)
   - Current: **Version 8** (June 1, 2020) ‚úÖ
   - Previous: Version 7 (June 1, 2018)
   - This is the specification document version

2. **Boarding Pass Format Version** (Data Field)
   - Single character field in the boarding pass data
   - Located at the start of conditional items
   - Values: "5", "6", "7", etc.
   - Indicates conditional items structure version
   - Parsed and stored in `BoardingPass.version`

### üÜï Version 8 Changes (Effective June 1, 2020)

**Field 15 - Passenger Description / Gender Code:**
- Added **"X"** = Unspecified gender
- Added **"U"** = Undisclosed gender
- Existing codes (M, F, 0-9) remain valid

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully supported - the library already parses this field correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Field Validation:** The parser does not validate field values against IATA code tables (e.g., airport codes, carrier codes)
2. **Date Conversion:** Julian dates are not automatically converted to calendar dates
3. **Year Rollover:** End-of-year date handling (Dec 31 ‚Üí Jan 1) may need special handling in your application
4. **Non-Standard Formats:** Some airlines may use proprietary variations that don't strictly follow IATA standard

### üîß Recent Updates

- **Version 8 Compliance:** Updated to IATA Resolution 792 Version 8 (June 2020) - supports new gender codes X and U
- **Segment Parsing:** Fixed critical bug where subsequent flight segments incorrectly used mandatory parsing instead of conditional
- **Loop Bounds:** Fixed off-by-one errors in bag tag and segment loops
- **Error Handling:** Improved error messages for conditional parsing failures
- **Documentation:** Added comprehensive field documentation and IATA standard references

## Testing

The library includes test cases for:
- Single-leg boarding passes (M1)
- Multi-leg boarding passes (M2, M3)
- Various airlines and formats
- Security data variations
- Conditional items edge cases

To run tests:
```bash
swift test
```
