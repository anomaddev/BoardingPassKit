/// Represents a single flight segment (leg) in a Bar Coded Boarding Pass (BCBP).
///
/// Each boarding pass may contain one or more legs corresponding to individual flight segments.
/// The first leg has an index of 0, with subsequent legs representing additional segments of the journey.
/// This struct encapsulates the mandatory fields defined by the BCBP specification, including the record locator (PNR),
/// origin and destination airport codes, operating carrier, flight number, and other essential travel details.
///
/// Additionally, it includes an optional conditional segment (`conditionalData`) that contains extended airline-specific information,
/// which is not part of the mandatory BCBP fields but may provide further details relevant to the passenger or flight.
///
/// `BoardingPassLeg` instances are used within the larger boarding pass decoding system to parse and represent each flight segment
/// individually, allowing for detailed inspection and processing of multi-leg itineraries encoded within a single boarding pass.
